2. Open NXBoot on your phone.
3. Select your bootcode.
4. Press `Boot now`.

### Launch Atmosphère

1. Once Hekate loads, using the volume and power buttons, select `Launch - > Atmosphere`.
2. To verify that Atmosphère launched properly, go to the System Settings and then scroll down to "System". Behind the line `Current system version:`, you should see your Switch's firmware version and `(AMS x.y.z)`. `x.y.z` are numbers that indicate the version of Atmosphère you are currently running.
3. Once your Switch boots, you can open the album applet to load the Homebrew Launcher.
