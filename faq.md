## RCM related
{: #rcm}

**Q: My Switch shows no screen when turning on/"help I'm bricked"**{: #not-bricked}

A: You are not bricked. What this means is that your Switch has booted into RCM mode. Connect your Switch to a computer and follow the guide to start Hekate.

**Q: When I connect my Switch to my computer, there is no APX device listed in Zadig!**{: #not-zadig}

A: Make sure your Switch is in RCM before you connect it to your computer. If you see a device called "Nintendo Switch" in Zadig's list, you didn't connect your Switch in RCM. Close Zadig, unplug your Switch, put it in RCM, reconnect your switch and reopen Zadig.

## Ban related
{: #ban}

**Q: How do I prevent getting banned? What are some of the common causes for bans?**{: #prevent-ban}

A: Nintendo has been rather strict when it comes to banning homebrew systems. If you want to be safe, don't do any of the following:

- Install pirated content/gamecart dumps.
- Cheat or edit saves in games with online functionality
- Modify your NAND
- Using your Switch's client cert to connect to the CDN in an unauthorized manner.
- Using untested Homebrew on a system without a reimplemented creport KIP. (Note: Atmosphere patches creport by default.)

Note that the current setup given in the guide prevents you from doing the first bullet,as the given Atmosphere setup at the moment does not supply sigpatches, which are needed to install this type of content. Finally, Atmosphere will in the future release "Thermosphere". Thermosphere is Atmospheres implementation of emuNAND. This will result into being able to create an offline version of your NAND which you can use to safely test homebrew.

**Q: How does Nintendo ban my system?**{: #how-ban}

A: Depends on the context. By far the majority of bans are due to the Switch's error reporting and general telemetry (telemetry is the collection of data). If any of the collected data looks out of place to Nintendo, they can ban your system.

Users in European regions should go [here](https://accounts.nintendo.com/setting){: .a-table target="_blank"}, click on the "Edit" button next to usage information and untick both options and click "Save changes". While this will not fully disable telemetry, it will disable the majority of it.

## Homebrew related
{: #homebrew}


**Q: My switch won't boot after I select Atmosphere in hekate!**{: #sys-ftpd}

A: Make sure you _don't_ have `sys-ftpd.kip` in the `kips` directory. `sys-ftpd` does not work on firmware versions on or below 3.0.0.

**Q: Does this guide work on 6.1**{: #can-i-run-on}

A: This guide fully works on system version 6.1 and any version below.

**Q: What is the recommend microSD card size for homebrew?**{: #recommended-size}

A: The recommended size is 128GB. This will permit you to both have an emuNAND and allows you to make a full NAND dump without issue, while also leaving enough storage space for games and homebrew.

**Q: Why is only Atmosphere and Hekate supported? What about SX OS and ReiNX?**{: #why-atmosphere-hekate}

A: SX OS is unsupported as it's primary usecase is piracy, as well as stealing code from Atmosphere. In addition, SX OS has homebrew compatability issues with Atmosphere and Hekate which wont be supported.

ReiNX on the other hand does not reimplement creport, which results in an increased chance of bans and makes development more difficult, as error reports are not dumped to the SD card, as well as making use of Atmosphére's sysmodules with a rename on the folders.

**Q: You say emuNAND will resolve all these issues, but SX OS offers an emuNAND already. Why can't I just use that one?**{: #sx-not-so-nand}

A: SX OS's emuNAND is not the same implementation as a "proper" emuNAND. SX OS's implementation instead clones the sysNAND, removes a lot of the unused space and stores it as a file on the sysNAND. Then, SX OS uses that file when booting into "emuNAND". As a result, SX OS's "emuNAND" can't be updated, and there might be a risk involved when going over the allocated amount of space for the "emuNAND", as Nintendo still reports the full NAND size on "emuNAND". This comes in addition to the fact that since this "emuNAND" is stored on the sysNAND, it doesn't provide any protection, should your sysNAND become corrupted, as this will also result in this emuNAND becoming unbootable.
