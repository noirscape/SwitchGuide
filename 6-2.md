title: System update 6.2
---

## What happened on firmware 6.2?

Firmware 6.2 changed the way the Nintendo Switch derives it's package1 keys. The new method makes use of the TSEC keys.

This effectively patches Atmosphere, ReiNX, SX OS and any other CFW until these keys are broken.

## I'm on 6.2, can I still do anything?

You can still run implementations of switch-linux (this includes Lakka) and make a dump of your NAND. You cannot run CFW.

### Can I downgrade to 6.1?

**If you've never ran CFW before, no.** If you _have_ run CFW, this becomes a maybe although it will come with the inconvenience of requiring AutoRCM. This is because 6.1 burns one of the Switch's update fuses, which effectively prevents downgrades. This is because the Switch verifies how many fuses are burnt on each boot and if it is higher than it expects, it crashes. Hekate and Atmosphere both disable these fuse checks.

If you have a NAND dump of 6.1, you can always restore this dump through Hekate.

Otherwise, you'll need to have dumped your BIS keys _before updating to 6.2_ and you can follow the instructions [here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/how-to-install-run-any-switch-firmware-unofficially-without-burning-any-fuses.507461/) to downgrade back to 6.1. _Note: Highly untested, you may run into strange issues._

Regardless of your choice, you will need to enable AutoRCM through Hekate (`Tools` -> `AutoRCM` -> `Enabled`).

### AutoRCM caveats

AutoRCM has a couple of caveats, hence why we usually don't recommend it for normal usage, but if you have to downgrade, you'll have to use it.

These caveats are:
- Your Nintendo Switch won't power off properly anymore. When selecting "Power off" or "Restart" in the Switch's power button menu, it will reboot into RCM instead.
- If your Nintendo Switch's battery dies, you'll need to put it in the charger for several hours in order to make it get enough charge to launch Atmosphere again (note: You _can_ safely launch Hekate, which you should do in order to speed up charging).
- Regardless of how you put it, AutoRCM is a controlled brick, and this comes with the caveat that something strange may happen one day with your Switch.
- AutoRCM is removed on system updates and will need to be reapplied manually.

## I'm on 6.1, is there anything I can do to block updates?

The easiest solution is to enable Airplane Mode. If this is not a feasible option (because you still need to connect your Switch to the network to transfer files or similar reasons), you can use 90DNS. See the instructions below on how to set it up.

1. Open the settings applet on your Switch.
2. Go to `Internet` -> `Internet Settings`.
3. You will see a list of all WiFi networks nearby and those you've ever been connected to.
4. For each network you've been connected to, select it and choose `Change settings`
5. Change `DNS` to `Manual`.
6. Set the primary DNS server to `163.172.141.219`.
7. Set the secondary DNS `45.248.48.62`.
8. Press the save button and then `B` to return to the network list.
9. Repeat steps 4 to 8 for all WiFi networks you've been connected to.
10. Press the Home button to get back to the main menu.

When connecting to a new WiFi network, you will have to do so manually to be able to set these DNS settings when connecting to it directly. If you are in an area with a Nintendo Zone nearby, your Switch might automatically connect to this Nintendo Zone. These networks come preconfigured in the Switch and there is no way to override the DNS settings for them.
