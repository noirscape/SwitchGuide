title: System update 6.2

## What happened on firmware 6.2?

Firmware 6.2 changed the way the Nintendo Switch derives it's package1 keys. The new method makes use of the TSEC keys.

This effectively patches Atmosphère, ReiNX, SX OS and any other CFW until these keys are broken.

## I'm on 6.2, can I still do anything?

Yes. Methods exist to downgrade a Switch to firmware version 6.1. At the time of writing however these are out of the scope of this guide. This mainly being because of AutoRCM. AutoRCM is a method that is needed to make the Switch always enter RCM to prevent it from panicking at boot, but due to the large amount of issues and side-effects, we do not support it at the time of writing (this may change in the future.)

Regardless of downgrades, you will still be able to run Switch-Linux, dump your NAND using Hekate or run Lakka.

### AutoRCM caveats

AutoRCM has a couple of caveats, hence why we usually don't recommend it for normal usage. Please refer to the list below of major issues.

These caveats are:
- Your Nintendo Switch won't power off properly anymore. When selecting "Power off" or "Restart" in the Switch's power button menu, it will reboot into RCM instead. If you want to completely power off your Switch, select `Poweroff` in the Hekate bootmenu.
- If your Nintendo Switch's battery dies, you'll need to put it in the charger for several hours in order to make it get enough charge to launch Atmosphère again (note: You _can_ safely launch Hekate, which you should do in order to speed up charging).
- Regardless of how you put it, AutoRCM is a controlled brick, and this comes with the caveat that something strange may happen one day with your Switch.
- AutoRCM is removed on system updates and will need to be reapplied manually.
- **Because you'll be using incorrect fuses, whenever you put your Switch in sleep mode, you'll have to reboot your Switch and reinject the payload. (The Switch checks for the fuses when waking from sleep mode.)**

## I'm on 6.1, is there anything I can do to block updates?

The easiest solution is to enable Airplane Mode. If this is not a feasible option (because you still need to connect your Switch to the network to transfer files or similar reasons), you can use 90DNS. See the instructions below on how to set it up.

1. Open the settings applet on your Switch.
2. Go to `Internet` -> `Internet Settings`.
3. You will see a list of all WiFi networks nearby and those you've ever been connected to.
4. For each network you've been connected to, select it and choose `Change settings`
5. Change `DNS` to `Manual`.
6. Set the primary DNS server to `163.172.141.219`.
7. Set the secondary DNS `45.248.48.62`.
8. Press the save button and then `B` to return to the network list.
9. Repeat steps 4 to 8 for all WiFi networks you've been connected to.
10. Press the Home button to get back to the main menu.

When connecting to a new WiFi network, you will have to do so manually to be able to set these DNS settings when connecting to it directly. If you are in an area with a Nintendo Zone nearby, your Switch might automatically connect to this Nintendo Zone. These networks come preconfigured in the Switch and there is no way to override the DNS settings for them.

In addition, you should dump your BIS keys. See [here](biskeydump.html) on how to get these keys. These keys are needed in case you accidentally upgrade without a backup. You _could_ retrieve them later but it's a much bigger pain to do so and risks bricking your Switch.
